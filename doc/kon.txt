- Kon homework
  - Create a method that gives the bounds for a sampleset
  - Create a method all all the people tagged in a sampleset and the number of samples they each have.
  - Create a method that splits a sampleset on jumps into multiple sample sets
    - Find local maxima
	- Split on samples
	- Make sure you always include data from other sensors that is coincident so you can filter on that after.
  - Create a class for taking an asset (sample set) and a set of clips (other samplesets) in that asset and spitting out an xml for FinalCut
  - Complete the structure for woo data
    - Get to the point where you can do something like:
	  ss = SampleSet.new([SoloShotSensor, WooSensor]);
	  Importer.new(SoloShotSensor, "./solo.csv", ss).import
	  Importer.new(WooSensor, "./woo.csv", ss).import
	  assets = ss.split_on_recording
	  kon_footage = assets.last.tagged(kon)
	  kon_woo_jumps = kon_footage.woo_jumps
	  xml = XmlExporter.new(kon_footage, kon_woo_jumps)
	  
DONE
  - Create a method that gives the length of a sampleset
